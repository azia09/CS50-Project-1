# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For my project, I designed a website presenting the Pakistan Cricket Team. I have
devoted one file  (General.html) to provide a basic introduction to the team, describing
their achievements and global reputation.

The sport has three different formats: T20, ODI, and Test cricket, setting it apart from other popular athletics. My next three files provide more information surrounding the team's performance against different opposition, their global ranking, and the team roster with respect to these different formats.
